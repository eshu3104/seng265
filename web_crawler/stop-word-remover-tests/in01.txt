You were hired to work in a team that is building a new web search engine.
Without much experience on the subject, and counting only with a small team,
your team lead decided to take small steps.
Another teammate is building the crawler, which produces a file with web links.
On the other hand, you will be responsible for checking such text files with web links,
downloading and organizing the files in a local Unix filesystem.
